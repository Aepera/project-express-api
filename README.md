# Express API Project

In this project I have created an API with Express, that has several RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

My API uses a hardcoded JSON file that contains Netflix data. I have then constructed the following endpoints:

- Query route for filtering on title, director and year released.

- Route for accessing a single movie or TV serie, by title. Returns an object.

- Route that returns all movies and TV series from a certain country, in an array.

- Route that filters out all movies, in an array.

- Route that filters out all TV series, in an array.
